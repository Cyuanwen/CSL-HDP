# CSL-HDP
[ICME 2024] Common Sense Language-Guided Exploration and Hierarchical Dense Perception for Instruction Following Embodied Agents

## Introduction
We propose \textbf{C}ommon \textbf{S}ense \textbf{L}anguage-guided exploration (CSL), a novel approach that leverages common-sense knowledge from seen scenes and language information from language instructions to infer the location of objects. The proposed CSL significantly improves exploration efficiency. Additionally, we propose \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{D}ense \textbf{P}erception (HDP), which uses hierarchical-level features to perform semantic segmentation and depth estimation. The use of HDP significantly improves the agent's perceptual capabilities.
